Hello, and welcome to our project, the Bagel Personality Quiz! Here’s some background 
information on who we are, and why we decided to make this. Our names are Sage, Gen, and Neha, 
and we’re all freshmen at UMD. We met this year in the ACES Program here, and ever since then, 
we’ve grown and strengthened an amazing girl-gang group of friends who all have so much love 
for computer science and for each other. We came into Technica not quite sure where we’d fit 
in due to our relative lack of experience in coding and the technology world. All we knew was 
this, we wanted to create something, and something that mattered to us, so we would learn and 
grow from every mistake, so that we would be able to participate in the unstoppable force that 
is women in computing, and so we could commemorate our friendship, and how much it matters to 
us even in such a relatively short period of knowing each other. 

So we created this, a bagel personality quiz, because bagels are a staple of our morning breakfast 
runs, and in addition to computer science, we have a passion for reminding people of their 
strengths and worth, even in a means that might seem as silly as a short quiz. Over the course of 
this weekend, with every time we exclaimed and hugged after fixing a problem with our code, and 
every brainstorming session of what people need to hear but aren’t told enough, and finally, every 
genuine smile we saw when someone got the results of this quiz, this project has come to mean more 
and more to us. We hope we can share that with you today, knowing that this is just the beginning 
of our journey as women in tech, and that we have the power to make a positive impact on other 
people’s lives in both the biggest and the smallest of ways :)
